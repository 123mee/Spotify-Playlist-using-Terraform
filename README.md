## Terraform Spotify Playlist Creator ##

This project demonstrates how to use Terraform to automate the creation of a Spotify playlist. By leveraging Terraform's infrastructure-as-code approach, we can manage Spotify playlists programmatically.

**Prerequisites:**  
Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:

*Terraform (v0.12+)*  
*A Spotify Developer Account*  
*Spotify API credentials (Client ID and Client Secret)*  


**Setup**  
*Clone the repository:*  
*Configure Spotify API Credentials:*  
*Alternatively, you can export the credentials directly in your shell environment:*  
*Initialize Terraform:*  
*Plan and apply Terraform:*  
*Apply the configuration to create your Spotify playlist:*  

During the terraform apply process, you'll be prompted to authenticate your Spotify account. Follow the on-screen instructions to authorize access.

**Once the process is complete, check your Spotify account for the newly created playlist.**
